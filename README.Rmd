# USC SDGmap R Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `SDGmapR` is to provide an open-source foundation for the systematic mapping
to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this R package one can find publicly available [SDG keyword datasets](https://github.com/pwu97/SDGmapR/tree/main/datasets) in the `tidy` data format, the [UN Official SDG color scheme](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pdf) and [SDG Descriptions](https://github.com/pwu97/SDGmapR/blob/main/datasets/sdg_desc_cleaned.csv), and several functions related to the mapping of text to particular sets of keywords.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [Github](https://github.com/USC-Office-of-Sustainability/USC-SDGmap) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USC-Office-of-Sustainability/USC-SDGmap")
```

## Publicly Available SDG Keywords

The table below lists publicly available SDG keywords that have been published online. Some
of the lists have weights associated with every keyword, while some do not. For the purposes
of the `SDGmapR` package, we will assign an equal weight of one to every word if weights are not given. 
Note that the column for `SDG17` will represent whether the dataset has keywords
related to SDG17.

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
