# USC SDGmap R Package

Peter Wu at Carnegie Mellon wrote the initial code that inspired this
project, and his original R package can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/pwu97/SDGmapR). At USC, Brian Tinsley and
Dr.Â Julie Hopper in the Office of Sustainability have been working to
develop this package further and raise sustainability awareness in
higher education by mapping USC course descriptions to the United
Nations Sustainability Development Goals.

The goal of `SDGmapR` is to provide an open-source foundation for the
systematic mapping to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). In this R package one can find publicly available [SDG keyword
datasets](https://github.com/USC-Office-of-Sustainability/USC-SDGmap/tree/main/Keyword%20Lists)
in the `tidy` data format, the [UN Official SDG color
scheme](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pdf)
and several functions related to the mapping of text to particular sets
of keywords.
